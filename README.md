This is just a simple project I am working out for practice/experience.  I used a modified version of Skeleton for SASS* to style this project and tweaked it for my purposes.
To compile SASS I used Grunt and node.js.
I primarily used GitHub to manage files more easily, and they were uploaded with Deploy and seldomly with FileZilla.
Finally this site is hosted by GoDaddy and will change drastically as I learn more.
Creating this site has been a challenging experience, however extremely rewarding.  I feel comfortable creating and maintaining a site at this time.
