This is just a simple project I am working on for practice/experience.  I used a modified version of Skeleton for SASS* to style this project and tweaked it for my purposes.  To be honest I got very into taking apart this guy's skeleton piece by piece and replace it with my own.  Does that make me a murderer or a mad man?  Time will tell.

To compile SASS I used Grunt and node.js.
I primarily used GitHub to manage files more easily, and they were uploaded with Deploy and seldomly with FileZilla.

Finally this site is hosted by GoDaddy and will change drastically as I learn more.
Creating this site has been a challenging experience, however extremely rewarding. I feel comfortable creating and maintaining a site at this time.

Addendum(11/11/15) - I began this project to create a really modern sleek website.  Instead I have started a ground work that I would like to be able market as my own and help others build their sites.  Is it possible to create one master skeleton with a growing list of themes to drastically alter pages?  I think about that more later, in the mean time, check out kirby getting down:
